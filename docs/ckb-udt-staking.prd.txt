# Overview  
The CKB UDT Staking Framework is a general-purpose, fully decentralized infrastructure that enables any UDT token project to implement comprehensive staking reward programs on the Nervos CKB blockchain. The framework supports both traditional possession-based rewards (airdrop model) and liquid staking with LST minting, providing maximum flexibility for diverse token economics while maintaining complete decentralization through immutable, time-locked configurations.

The platform solves the fundamental problem of lacking standardized, decentralized staking and reward distribution infrastructure in the CKB ecosystem. It addresses: (1) absence of generic staking and reward frameworks for any UDT token, (2) need for both traditional airdrop and liquid staking reward models, (3) requirement for automated reward distribution without admin controls, (4) demand for time-period based reward distribution systems, and (5) necessity for time-locked configurations that prevent manipulation after deployment.

The framework targets any UDT token project seeking to implement staking reward programs through airdrop or issuance models. Projects deposit reward amounts for specific time periods, and token holders automatically receive distributions based on their staking history during those periods. The system operates through public key-based configuration setup with time-locked immutability and fully automated execution without any governance mechanisms.

The value proposition centers on providing a universal framework where any token project can deploy staking reward programs with configurable parameters, enabling traditional airdrop-style staking rewards initially and liquid staking issuance subsequently, all through simple deposit-based reward pools without requiring centralized administration or governance - achieving true set-and-forget decentralized reward distribution infrastructure.

# Core Features  
**Generic UDT Staking Reward Framework**
- Universal staking reward infrastructure supporting any UDT token through configurable token addresses
- Single-token staking reward program model where each program configures rewards for one specific UDT token
- **Two reward approaches**: Traditional possession-based rewards (airdrop model) and liquid staking with LST minting
- **Possession-based rewards**: Reward existing token holders based on their holdings across time periods without minting new tokens
- Real-time reward calculations and distribution tracking for the configured token
- Framework reusability allowing different token projects to create their own independent staking reward programs

**Traditional Airdrop-Style Possession Rewards (Phase 1)**
- **Possession Across Time Periods**: Reward token holders based on their possession/holding patterns across defined time periods without requiring new staking actions
  - **No New Token Minting**: Works with existing token holdings - rewards holders of already staked tokens or tokens locked in specific lock code hashes
  - **Flexible Target Selection**: Can target regular UDT tokens, already staked tokens, or tokens locked with specific lock code hashes
- **Snapshot-Based Possession Tracking**: 
  - **Periodic Snapshots**: Snapshots taken periodically to evaluate average token possession during time periods
  - **Public Trigger System**: Trigger-based snapshots with logic stored on website, chronologically triggerable by AWS Lambda functions or manually
  - **Trigger Payment Model**: Trigger initiator pays for transaction costs
  - **Public Authorization**: Anyone can trigger snapshots and get same results following Type rules
  - **Inclusion-Only Policy**: Cannot remove existing snapshots showing others' possession, but can add your own snapshot if you possess tokens
- **Deposit-Based Reward Model**: Airdrop reward programs deposit total reward amounts upfront for specific time periods
  - **Automatic Distribution**: At period conclusion, rewards automatically distributed based on possession history during that period
  - **Time-Based Calculation**: Rewards calculated based on average possession from periodic snapshots during the period
- **Set-and-Forget Operation**: No ongoing management required - fully automated distribution based on deposited amounts and period parameters

**Liquid Staking with LST Minting Infrastructure (Phase 2)**
- **Actual Liquid Staking**: Users stake UDT tokens and receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) representing their staked positions
  - **LST Token Minting**: New LST tokens minted to represent staked UDT positions
  - **CKB Time-Lock Integration**: Support for CKB time-lock mechanisms to enforce staking periods and require specific time-lock conditions when staking UDT tokens (to be implemented)
- **Pool-Based Reward Model**: Token projects can deposit reward tokens to the staking pool anytime at any amount
  - **Exchange Ratio Enhancement**: Reward deposits increase the LST-to-underlying token exchange ratio, benefiting all LST holders proportionally.
  - **Continuous Pool Deposits**: Reward tokens can be deposited to staking pool at any time, immediately enhancing the exchange ratio for all LST holders
- **Secondary Market & Unstaking**:
  - Secondary market support for LST trading while maintaining underlying staked positions
  - Unstaking mechanisms through LST burning with time-lock expiration and configurable cooldown periods
  - Cross-protocol LST integration capabilities for DeFi composability

**Decentralized Configuration System**
- **Initial Configuration Setup**: Public key-based configuration for reward parameters and time periods
  - Time-locked configuration immutability preventing any modifications after program setup period
  - Configurable setup period (e.g., 7 days) during which contributors can set parameters
  - Multi-signature configuration validation requiring multiple public key confirmations
- **Automated Finalization**: 
  - Automated parameter finalization after time-lock expiration with no admin override capabilities
  - Transparent configuration history and immutable audit trail on-chain
- **Reward Period Management**: Configuration for time periods, deposit amounts, and distribution methods

**Automated Reward Distribution**
- **Airdrop/Possession-Based Distribution (Period-Based)**:
  - **Triggered Distribution**: Rewards distributed at period conclusion, triggerable by anyone based on possession histories
  - **Public Trigger Authorization**: Anyone can trigger reward distribution following possession history verification rules
  - **Deposit Management**: Token projects deposit total reward amounts upfront for each period
  - Automated reward calculation based on possession history during the period and configured parameters
  - Multiple reward token support (native CKB, any UDT tokens) through token address configuration
  - Fair distribution algorithms considering possession weight, duration within period, and participation patterns
  - Historical reward tracking across all periods and distributions
- **Liquid Staking Distribution (Continuous)**:
  - **No Distribution Required**: Reward deposits automatically enhance LST exchange ratio without distribution actions
  - **Immediate Effect**: Pool deposits instantly benefit all LST holders proportionally through improved exchange ratio
  - **Continuous Operation**: Programs can deposit rewards anytime, immediately affecting the staking pool value
- **Set-and-Forget Model**: No ongoing management required after initial configuration

# Risks and Mitigations  
**Technical Challenges**
- Smart contract security vulnerabilities: Implement comprehensive testing, formal verification, and multiple security audits for generic framework
- Generic UDT token support complexity: Design flexible smart contracts that work with any UDT token while maintaining security
- Decentralized configuration system security: Ensure robust multi-signature validation and time-lock mechanisms preventing manipulation
- Liquid staking token (LST) economic model: Design sustainable LST mechanisms that maintain value correlation with underlying assets
- Cross-token compatibility and standardization: Ensure framework works seamlessly with diverse UDT token implementations
- Public key management and multi-signature coordination: Implement secure, user-friendly multi-sig workflows for configuration

**MVP Strategy and Scope**
- Core MVP focuses exclusively on **possession-based rewards with period management** - reward token holders based on their holdings across defined time periods without new token minting
- **Deposit-based reward model**: Token projects deposit total reward amounts upfront for specific periods, with automatic distribution at conclusion
- **Target existing holdings**: Reward holders of existing tokens, already staked tokens, or tokens locked with specific lock code hashes
- Single-token staking reward program model where each program configures rewards for one specific UDT token
- Prioritize possession tracking over liquid staking for initial validation, as it requires simpler smart contracts and clearer user flows
- Implement decentralized configuration system first to establish foundation for true decentralization
- Build liquid staking with LST minting and CKB time-lock integration as separate phase (Phase 2) after possession rewards are working
- **CKB Time-Lock Dependency**: Liquid staking phase requires CKB time-lock implementation to be completed first
- Use testnet extensively with single-token staking reward programs to validate possession-based reward model before adding LST complexity

**Resource and Timeline Constraints**
- Generic framework complexity may require additional development time: Plan modular development with clear separation between possession rewards and pool-based staking
- Single-token staking reward program testing requires thorough validation: Develop comprehensive testing frameworks for diverse UDT token scenarios
- Decentralized configuration coordination challenges: Plan clear processes for multi-signature setup and time-lock management
- Token project adoption and framework education: Create comprehensive documentation for both users and staking reward program creators
- Direct possession reward simplicity advantage: Reduced complexity compared to multi-token approach allows faster MVP development

**Market and Adoption Risks**
- Limited UDT token project adoption: Focus on creating easy staking reward program setup experience with simple period-based reward model
- Competition from centralized reward distribution services: Differentiate through true decentralization, deposit-based transparency, and set-and-forget simplicity
- Period-based reward model complexity: Design intuitive interface clearly showing period timelines, participation, and expected distributions
- Regulatory uncertainty around token rewards: Design flexible framework that can adapt to diverse regulatory requirements across token projects through configurable period parameters
